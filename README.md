# Assignment - HappyU Food Ordering System

## Inspiration
This project was part of a university course on introductory Java. Our [group](#contributers) was tasked with creating a self-ordering system using Java.
The project was meant to be a simple application but we decided to extend the project to make it more dynamic by adding the use of `.csv` files to efficiently store the restaurants menu and allow easy updating of the menu.

## Features
- Allows importing menu from a `menu.csv` file
- Allows categorising food items by defining categories in `categories.csv`
- Displays menu in a [easy-to-understand view](#menu)
- Allows [easy selection of order](#add-order) and [easy removal of order](#remove-order)
- Displays [order summary](#receipt)
- Reports [revenue details to owner](#revenue-tally-for-owner)
